// When is Cheryl's Birthday

import Cocoa

// 1. Albert and Bernard just became friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gave them a list of 10 possible dates:
//       May 15       May 16       May 19
//      June 17      June 18
//      July 14      July 16
//    August 14    August 15    August 17

// 2. Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard seperately the month and day of the birthday respectively.
// 3. Albert  : I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard does not know too.
// 4. Bernard : At first I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know now.
// 5. Albert  : Then I also know when Cheryls birthday is.

// So when is Cheryl's Birthday?

// Overall Strategy
// When Cheryl tells Albert "May" then he knows there are three possibilities, but we (the puzzle solvers) don't, because we don't know what Cheryl said. So what can we do? We will consider all of the possible dates, one at a time. For example, first consider "May 15". Cheryl tells Albert "May" and Bernard "15", giving them the lists of possible birthdates shown above. We can then check whether statements 3 through 5 are true in this scenario. If they are, then "May 15" is a solution to the puzzle. Repeat the process for each of the possible dates. If all goes well, there should be exactly one solution.

// Albert: After Cheryl told me the month of her birthdate, I didn't know her birthday. I don't know which day Cheryl told Bernard, but I know that for all of the possible dates, if Bernard is told that day, he wouldn't know the birthdate.

// Bernard: At first Cheryl told me the day, and I didn't know. Then I considered just the dates for which Albert's statement3 is true, and now I know.
