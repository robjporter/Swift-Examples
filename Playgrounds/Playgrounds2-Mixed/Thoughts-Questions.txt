Swift Thoughts and Questions

- How do you get pretty printing of instances in the playground?
- Could you get a pretty printout of something like a 2D matrix?
- How does Phase two of object initialization work?
- In the Deinitialization Chapter is the Bank object (that only contains Type properties and methods) a hacky way of having a singleton?
- The Player deinitialization method doesn't get called in the playground when the playerOne variable is set to nil.

In "Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C"
- let myTextField = UITextField(frame: CGRect(0.0, 0.0, 200.0, 40.0)) is corrected by the playground autocorrecto to let myTextField = UITextField(frame: CGRect(x: 0.0, y: 0.0, width: 200.0, height: 40.0))
- myTextField.editing = false is reported as an error as editing is not allowed to be assigned.
- The following doesn't seem to work in a playground
let myLength = myObject.length? 
if let fifthCharacter = myObject.characterAtIndex(5) {
    println("Found \(fifthCharacter) at index 5")
}
- let squareRoot = Float(sqrt(3)) gives an "Ambiguous use of sqrt in Beta 3". It doesn't look like you can call sqrt() on an integer.

- The following code gives a error in the playground no matter what object and UIButton are. 
if object is UIButton {
    // object is of type UIButton
} else {
    // object is not of type UIButton
}
