    <p>In the last post in this series, I took at look at the protocols that Swift uses to define generators, sequences and collections. In this post I am going to present examples of using the Standard Library Functions that operate on these types. I&#39;ll run through them in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Throughout this post I will use &quot;a <code>SequenceType</code>&quot; as a shorthand for &quot;an object conforming to <code>SequenceType</code> protocol&quot; and similar shorthand for other type-like protocols.</p>
<p>I have purposely left out the function definitions. In the playground for the post you can option click to see the gory details.</p>
<p>So without further ado let&#39;s get going.</p>
